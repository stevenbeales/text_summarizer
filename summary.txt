    Like a bowling ball on a skating rink, the black geodesic sphere of the East
    Greenland Ice-Core Project's communal living space stands out against the
    endless white nothingness of the Greenland ice sheet. If all the ice
    covering the world's largest island were to thaw, sea levels would rise
    roughly 6 meters. And the same processes at work on Greenland's glaciers at
    the top of the world could send vast sections of Antarctica's ice sheet into
    the sea as well, raising ocean levels even further. Departing from
    Kangerlussuaq, VOA visited East GRIP and other remote corners of Greenland
    with the 109th Airlift Wing of the U.S. Air National Guard for a firsthand
    look at science in action at the leading edge of climate change.
