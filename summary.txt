    Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is applied when a machine
    mimics "cognitive" functions that humans associate with other human minds,
    such as "learning" and "problem solving". The scope of AI is disputed: as
    machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered as requiring
    "intelligence" are often removed from the definition, a phenomenon known as
    the AI effect, leading to the quip in Tesler's Theorem, "AI is whatever
    hasn't been done yet." "Keyword spotting" strategies for search are popular
    and scalable but dumb; a search query for "dog" might only match documents
    with the literal word "dog" and miss a document with the word "poodle". The
    net forms "concepts" that are distributed among a subnetwork of shared[j]
    neurons that tend to fire together; a concept meaning "leg" might be coupled
    with a subnetwork meaning "foot" that includes the sound for "foot".
